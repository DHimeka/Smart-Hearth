# Smart-Hearth
This is the project that we carried out for the module Engineering Design Project during our second semester.
The smart hearth is equipped with a temperature sensor that helps maintain the fire's temperature based on the user's preferences. This was achieved by adjusting the speed of the DC fan accordingly. The user can select their desired temperature range using a knob on the user interface, and the chosen range will be shown on the OLED display. Safety measures are in place as well, with a buzzer alerting the user in case of any irregularities during operation. The hearth's enclosure design was meticulously crafted using SolidWorks, ensuring the appropriate choice of materials. Additionally, the PCB was carefully designed using Altium.

Amidst the scarcity and rising costs of gas cylinders in Sri Lanka, many households have turned to traditional hearths as an alternative. However, these hearths lack certain user-friendly features, such as the need for constant manual adjustment of the flame and the issue of soot deposition and cleaning after usage. Moreover, the smoke released during cooking can be bothersome.

To address these drawbacks, the idea is to develop a more advanced hearth with a DC fan that automatically regulates the heat once the user inputs their desired temperature. This innovation aims to save time and effort for consumers and make cooking more convenient.

To validate the demand for such a product, a survey was conducted among potential users. The results indicated that over 50% of respondents were significantly affected by the gas shortage, making an alternative like this hearth desirable. Most participants showed positive interest in purchasing the product, and none felt it was unnecessary.

Based on user expectations, the design was tailored to fulfill their needs. Regarding pricing, the initial survey suggested a range of Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000, but due to import bans and inflation, the market price for similar products has increased to around Rs 7,000 to Rs 11,000. Therefore, the final product may need to be priced at approximately Rs 8,000 or higher.
